              <li class="f-16-b">The spiral is designed almost like a seasonal calendar-clock, with January at 12 o'clock, April at 3 o'clock, July at 6 o'clock, and October at 9 o'clock. There are surges in cases between August and October, then again between September to February. I could appreciate the clock-style if it was more symmetrical.</li>
              <li class="f-16-b">It seems like going into July each year fools us into thinking Covid-19 is over, but then it grows again even bigger than the previous year. I wonder if it continued, would August to October be even thicker than it was in 2021?</li>

This can be seen in the part that‚Äôs labeled with the ‚Äú7-day average,‚Äù where there‚Äôs a slight uncertainty in the number of cases in each wave.</li>
              <li class="f-16-b">Not all the months are the same width; for example, April to May is much tighter than September to October. This makes me question whether it was to give more space to bigger pieces of information or if it's to exaggerate the cases to ignite more emotion in the viewer.</li>

  <h4>Design Critique:  </h4>
  <div class="col-12 mt-3">
    <p class="f-16-b mt-4">
      When you look at this data visualization, one has to ask the question: what is the illustrator‚Äôs purpose? If it was to grab my attention and make me curious what‚Äôs going on, then they definitely accomplished their goal. Was it to make waves on the media for its appearance while playing a metaphor of "spiraling" due to the surge in cases, then it hit the bullseye. But, if it was for me to easily understand and be properly informed about the ‚ÄúNew Covid-19 cases in the United States‚Äù as the title of the visualization suggests, then they didn‚Äôt really do the best job. Maybe I‚Äôm not a fan of spiral graphs? Possibly, but this wasn‚Äôt even that. As noted in my previous reading responses and class discussions, I‚Äôm a firm believer that data visualization should be easy to read and be presented in the simplest form, this particular spiral graph is not an example of that. 
      <br><br>
      Aside from the critique on color and imagery, which definitely does resemble a tapeworm or intentions, the aesthetics does not matter to me as much (I'm comfortable looking at a chart printed in just black on a off-white page of an old economics book). What matters is the functionality, in this case it ignited suspicion and confusion, with the values scattered everywhere and the linearity of the graph being not so uniform. This visualization was more memorable than it was useful, since the data was unnecessarily difficult to interpret and one would have to make an effort to understand the key takeaway. This could not go beyond an NYT article and be actually utilized to benefit the public.

I wanted to approach the three visualizations with simplicity and understability as the core priority, so I chose two types of line charts to accomplish this. Then, I added my own version of a stacked doughnut graph to test out a unique take on the traditional stacked doughnut graph that would be repurposed for the delivery. Each one has the ability to highlight the trends, make clear comparisons, and have appropriate proportions. The Multiple Line Graph was me presenting the clearest and cleanest version, it's easy to understand the comparisons of each month year-to-year with a glance with the colors being distinct. That being said, I only felt comfortable doing this type of chart since its three lines (three years) of data. I've seen this type of chart being used to compare 195 countries in the World Bank‚Äôs data and it's a complete disaster of clutter. The Small Multiples helped me present another uncluttered, but slightly more complex chart that allowed for side by side comparison that allowed me to visualize the magnitude a bit better. At the same time, it allows for one to view a year as isolated on its own, or to view it as a comparison to other years. I read Edward Tufte's book ‚ÄúEnvisioning Information‚Äù which is how I found this was a good approach to emphasizing temporal patterns without interference from overlapping data. The Stacked Doughnut Graph was taken from my old readings of market share, I had to rethink how to present it in the same fashion while incorporating a very different type of information. This is actually my favorite visualization I made for this project since its unorthodox, but still understandable. To counter the NYT visualization, I made the portions of each month equal, switch width with darkness of shade to present severity, and kept it as a ‚Äúwheel clock‚Äù since I did appreciate that feature. Overall, each visualization prioritizes clarity and comparison that can be used and understood by the general public. 
          <br><br>
          <h4 class="mb-3">Reflection </h4>
It was a tough decision to choose between the Small Multiples and Stacked Doughnut. However, while I feel that the Stacked Doughnut was unique, I felt that the Small Multiples ultimately served better to convey my critiques of the NYT visualization. Especially, the  need for clarity in year-over-year comparisons and reducing visual clutter and being something that can be used by the public. While it is an interactive visualization in which upon hovering you can gain further insights, the significance of this is that it can be utilized when it's static as well (in case it's printed out). By separating the years into distinct panels with consistent scales, the visualization allows the viewer to easily track trends within each year while still facilitating comparisons across years.  The use of color coding (blue for 2020, orange for 2021, and red for 2022) enhances visual distinction, making each year‚Äôs progression immediately clear. Additionally, numeric labels on each bar support precision without requiring the viewer to estimate values from the y-axis. That being said, similar to the line charts, this type of visualization is only good because there's only a few pieces (years of data). I have seen some of Edward Tufte‚Äôs Small Multiples examples when there‚Äôs a lot of information, it definitely becomes data dense and hard to read. The process of critique by redesign highlighted a core tradeoff: maximizing clarity for large peaks while retaining visibility for smaller trends. I countered any possible tensinsions and enhanced the balance between precision and accessibility by adding the bar charts which show both the new cases and cumulative cases within each month of each year. Overall, I achieved my main purpose of delivering a visualization that served its main purpose: ensuring people understand the situation with ease.
